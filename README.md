# CicloVi치rio - Bicycle Safety Monitor Project

## Introduction
CicloVi치rio is an Arduino-based project designed to enhance bicycle safety by monitoring various parameters during a cyclist's journey. It uses an ESP32 with 30 pins, an MPU6050 accelerometer, a VL53L0X laser distance sensor, a u-blox 6M NEO GPS module, and an SD card module to collect and store data related to bicycle safety.

## Project Overview
The CicloVi치rio project includes the following features:
- Monitoring lateral distances using two VL53L0X sensors to detect nearby obstacles.
- Measuring variations and vibrations using the MPU6050 accelerometer.
- Tracking the cyclist's route using the u-blox 6M NEO GPS module.
- Saving collected data to an SD card for later analysis.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 with 30 pins
- MPU6050 accelerometer
- VL53L0X laser distance sensors (x2)
- u-blox 6M NEO GPS module
- SD card module

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:
- [Adafruit VL53L0X Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VL53L0X)
- [Adafruit MPU6050 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPU6050)
- [TinyGPS++ Library](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus)
- [SD Card Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD)

Make sure to install these libraries in your Arduino IDE before uploading the code.

## Usage
1. Connect the hardware components as per the provided schematic (insert a schematic image if available).
2. Open the Arduino IDE, import the required libraries, and load the CicloVi치rio code.
3. Customize the code to suit your specific requirements, such as data collection intervals, data format, and SD card file names.
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
5. Power on the system and observe the data collection process.
6. Collected data will be saved to the SD card in the specified format.
